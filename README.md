This is currently just a skeleton project for a family recipe hub.
The goal is to create a web based portal to share family recipes. The portal
can also act as a backup to archive recipes and keep them safe from loss.

The frontend is currently just a create-react-app in typescript. 

The backend is a Spring Boot api.
